			<h2>Qanon leaders-- false prophets in our time!</h2>

<p>	I'm so amazed,shocked and saddened by what has happened to many Christians! Many have been drawn into the movement known as Qanon. It has grown in the Christian community and replaced a relationship with God in many lives. We are told in Matthew 7:13-20: "Beware of false prophets, who come in sheep's clothing,but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.You will know them by their fruit.Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles? ....Therfore by their fruit you will know them." Many leaders in the Qanon movement have used God's name and said some absolutely crazy ideas and concepts. They swear that it is from God but yet where is their credibility? Prophets in the Bible have made statements which came true. Many "leaders" of the Q movement say something will happen at a certain time but it doesn't happen. They, then, change the date for the event or give a reason why it didn't happen as they predicted. Everytime you turn around they make new claims, but do they happen? 
</p>
<p>	God is omniscient! He would never make the statements many of these people have said! God is concerned with your lives! Many of you have left your normal life to follow the Q movement. God's Word is personal! He would not want you to follow the crowd. He wants you to seek Him. We are told to "Resist the devil and he will flee from you. Draw near to God and He will draw near to you."(James 4:8) Later we are told in verse 13-"Come now, you who say,"Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, spend a year there, buy and sell, and make a profit; whereas you do not know what will happen tomorrow. For what is your life? Is it even a vapor that appears for a time and then vanishes away....But now you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil." Many Q leaders change a message to get more money and power! Don't follow them blindly! Be still and seek the wisdom of God before you listen to what these people are saying! Does it line up with the Bible? Is it something that helps you to become more loving and in self-control? Read Galations, Ephesians and Philippians and learn how to combat the true enemy of your soul! Many of the leaders of this Q movement, I believe, are heretical in their teachings!
</p>
<p>	Another issue that we should consider is content! There is alot of weird stuff out there! As a Christian, we are to not judge people and label them as a group! We can expose the lies of the enemy! Before God we each stand alone!and are accountable for our own actions! Instead of listening to others, seek God first! In Galatians 1:6-9 -"I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel,which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accured." It is my belief that people have replaced the true gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ with the Q message! The Q message controls too many lives! If any of you out there have lost your first love, and neglected your relationship with Jesus, it is time to put things right. God loves you. Many of the Q leaders are like wolves, and want your loyalty and money! Seek God. You must not be controlled by these false prophets. Use discernment and be very careful who you listen to!
