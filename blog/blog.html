<h4><strong><p>I recently called an old friend. We have known each other for years, and thoughts of calling her just came to my mind. Those thoughts kept coming! They were persistent, until I listened. God does that!  He will speak in His Spirit to us if we are still enough to listen! { We need to know Him first and believe that He will be there!}  As our heavenly Father, God is faithful to answer! One way or another- something will happen!  Anyway, I called. It was God's timing! One of her children had just been seriously hurt! God had listened!  My call had encouraged her in her faith. She knows that she could count on us to keep her in our prayers! She lives a long distance from us and she was reassured that God is there with her family and at work in their midst !
</p>
<p>She's had a tough time in life. She had three husbands. Her first husband had health issues and went through early dementia. A second was abusive!  She's had 7 kids to raise and some of them went through some rebellious periods!  Life has not been easy for her. She persevered and God has been faithful and provided for her needs!  She is now blessed with a Godly husband, and the kids have matured. Through it all, she never lost her faith.  She has remained thankful and her testamony  inspires me !
</p>
<p>God loves His childeren! I recently read a book-- "God is Just Not Fair" by Jennifer Rothschild. It;s excellent ! She became blind and wrestled with the changes it caused in her life!  She writes - - "You do not suffer because somewhere in the mind of God he has decided, 'Oh, she is such a sinner that she deserves to suffer.....We all deserve separation from God, which is the worst suffering the human soul can endure. ............. But I invite you to view the weight of it as an anchor that grounds you rather than as a millstone that pulls you under. The wonder, humility, and freedom that comes from embracing this truth can help you rest within your sorrow or suffering,,,,,, In His mercy and wisdom, God will always give you His best. He made that clear once and for all on the cross of Calvary."</p>
<p>As has been my message in past blogs, the most important decision we make in life is to humble yourself and seek a relatioship with the Lord God Almighty! It changes your life! You have a new understanding of suffering , trials and blessings! You realize that the world does not revolve around you and that you have a purpose far beyond anything you ever dreamed of! You are not alone! You have a family and a heavenly Father who you can access at any time!  He is real! He has given us His Word and His promises, and it is His desire that we can get to know Him better!
</p>
<p>My next Blog is Son Jesus! As we get to know what a great price He paid, we recognise that with the Holy Spirirt that is possible. Sometimes the lessons are hard, but they have long term results and rewards.

<div class="heading-bg " >January 1, 2023&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A New Year --- A New You!</div>
<div class="col-sm-12" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
   
<h4><strong><p>If you read my Christmas message, you will know what the title of my blog means. If you took your decision to seek God seriously, you are on a new path. With the Holy Spirit inside you, there should be a desire to find out more about the Father God who loves you! He wants to bless you! You are part of His family and is there for you. You have accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior and recieved the Holy Spirit as your councilor and companion. You have stepped out of the old shell and are new! This is your new year and a new you! The process is just beginning! It will be exciting as you see His hand in your life!</p>
<p>
      I have been a Christian for over 60 years. I have seen the difference faith means in a life!You really do see things differently! The more time you spend in prayer, fellowship and reading the Bible, the more you will gain in discernment. Discernment is the process of listening to God and evaluating your surroundings. It is wisdom. It is courage to act in a new way. With God as your guide, you will find the strength to say no to things that no longer have you under its control. As you seek God and find out what is true,  you sense a new reality. There is a spiritual dimension that has just opened up to you! You have new eyes to see. You can step away from, or stand up to desires that once held you in its grip! You are a new person! Don't let anyone say differently. You are in a spiritual battle that you were not aware of before! With Jesus on our side though, we know who wins! God has promised to be with you and never leave you! Like a loving, good Father, He is there with power and might!</p>

<div class="col-sm-12" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
   
<h4><strong><p>It's nearly the start of a new year, so it's the start of a new blog.  My last one was removed when we got rid of word press. We had to that because our site was hacked and bombarded with trash!! Why people are so mischievous and mean is a sad commentary on the state of the world - rather than be creative and life-giving ;  people want to hurt others! This is why Christmas is so important!
</p><p>In Luke 2:8-15, we are told:</br>
" And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of  the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them. "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all people. For  today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord! This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in clothes and lying in a manger."   
Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, prasing God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill to men!"
</p>
<p>This is a message to us all. We have sinned! We have found ourselves in a world that continues to spin out of control! It hasn't really changed from when Jesus first came as that baby! The sheppards were about as far from a rich life as you could find! They lived out doors and had none of the comforts we enjoy! They tended sheep- not a very cushy job! They were subject to the elements and the dangers lurking in the wild! That was their vocation! In that day the vocation and lifestyle was passed from generation to generation! There was no chance of improvement. Such was your lot in life!</p>

<div class="heading-bg " >April 25th, 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qanon leaders-- false prophets in our time!</div>
<div class="col-sm-12" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
   
<h4><strong><p>	I'm so amazed,shocked and saddened by what has happened to many Christians! Many have been drawn into the movement known as Qanon. It has grown in the Christian community and replaced a relationship with God in many lives. We are told in Matthew 7:13-20: "Beware of false prophets, who come in sheep's clothing,but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.You will know them by their fruit.Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles? ....Therfore by their fruit you will know them." Many leaders in the Qanon movement have used God's name and said some absolutely crazy ideas and concepts. They swear that it is from God but yet where is their credibility? Prophets in the Bible have made statements which came true. Many "leaders" of the Q movement say something will happen at a certain time but it doesn't happen. They, then, change the date for the event or give a reason why it didn't happen as they predicted. Everytime you turn around they make new claims, but do they happen? 
</p>
<p>	God is omniscient! He would never make the statements many of these people have said! God is concerned with your lives! Many of you have left your normal life to follow the Q movement. God's Word is personal! He would not want you to follow the crowd. He wants you to seek Him. We are told to "Resist the devil and he will flee from you. Draw near to God and He will draw near to you."(James 4:8) Later we are told in verse 13-"Come now, you who say,"Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, spend a year there, buy and sell, and make a profit; whereas you do not know what will happen tomorrow. For what is your life? Is it even a vapor that appears for a time and then vanishes away....But now you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil." Many Q leaders change a message to get more money and power! Don't follow them blindly! Be still and seek the wisdom of God before you listen to what these people are saying! Does it line up with the Bible? Is it something that helps you to become more loving and in self-control? Read Galations, Ephesians and Philippians and learn how to combat the true enemy of your soul! Many of the leaders of this Q movement, I believe, are heretical in their teachings!
</p>
<p>	Another issue that we should consider is content! There is alot of weird stuff out there! As a Christian, we are to not judge people and label them as a group! We can expose the lies of the enemy! Before God we each stand alone!and are accountable for our own actions! Instead of listening to others, seek God first! In Galatians 1:6-9 -"I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel,which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accured." It is my belief that people have replaced the true gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ with the Q message! The Q message controls too many lives! If any of you out there have lost your first love, and neglected your relationship with Jesus, it is time to put things right. God loves you. Many of the Q leaders are like wolves, and want your loyalty and money! Seek God. You must not be controlled by these false prophets. Use discernment and be very careful who you listen to!
