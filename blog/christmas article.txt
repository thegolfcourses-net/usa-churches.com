Merry Christmas! 
It's nearly the start of a new year, so it's the start of a new blog.  My last one was removed when we got rid of word press. We had to that because our site was hacked and bombarded with trash!! Why people are so mischievous and mean is a sad commentary on the state of the world - rather than be creative and life-giving ;  people want to hurt others! This is why Christmas is so important!
In Luke 2:8-15, we are told:
" And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of  the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them. "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all people. For  today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord! This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in clothes and lying in a manger."   
Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, prasing God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill to men!"
This is a message to us all. We have sinned! We have found ourselves in a world that continues to spin out of control! It hasn't really changed from when Jesus first came as that baby! The sheppards were about as far from a rich life as you could find! They lived out doors and had none of the comforts we enjoy! They tended sheep- not a very cushy job! They were subject to the elements and the dangers lurking in the wild! That was their vocation! In that day the vocation and lifestyle was passed from generation to generation! There was no chance of improvement. Such was your lot in life!
